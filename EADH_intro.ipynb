        "\n",
        "This is the first step to learning Python. The target audience for these tutorials is digital humanities, and other cross-disciplinary scholars and students who are not aiming to become programmers as such, but who wish to gain code literacy and the tools to do most of the computational side of their research themselves.\n",
        "\n",
        "If you already know the basics of Python you can move onto the next notebook (Beginner, Intermediate, or Advanced). If you know another programming language, you can use this notebook as a quick guide to Python syntax.\n",
        "\n",
        "There are many online tutorials and courses out there, some of them are even aimed at digital humanities scholars. This notebook differs from those in at least three respects: 1) There is a clear progression from total beginner up to machine learning, 2) it is interactive and requires no installations, 3) existing tools are linked to in order to minimize unecessary overlap.\n",
        "\n",
        "This notebook gives a cursory overview of Python concepts with links to more in-depth sources of information. For this first part, most of the links will be to the [w3schools Python page](https://www.w3schools.com/python/default.asp). This is a great free resource that lists all the basic functionalities of Python and allows you to run example code directly in your browser.\n",
        "\n",
        "This first notebook covers the topics of:\n",
        "\n",
        "1. Introduction to different data types and the basics of programming.\n",
        "2. Introduction to loops.\n",
        "3. Using packages, opening, modifying, and saving files.\n",
        "\n",
        "You can run Python code using a terminal-based application or an interpreter, or a notebook such as this. Most things work exactly the same whether you run them here or somewhere else. The code is identical.\n",
        "\n",
        "**To run code** on this notebook you should save a copy to your own drive (File -> save a copy in Drive) or if you don't have a Google account, you can use this notebook in Jupyter notebook. Once you've done that you can start playing with it. We recommend saving this notebook in your Drive and using it with Google Colab for simplicity and ease.\n",
        "\n",
        "Click on the \"play\" button on the left side of the next 'box', these boxes are refered to as cells. (The button appears when you hover your cursor over the [    ] brackets.) Or choose Runtime -> and then the appropriate choice.\n",
        "\n",
        "There's a lot of information in the beginning. These are concepts we will come back to over and over again and you do not need to remember everything from the get go."
