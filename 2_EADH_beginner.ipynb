        "3. One of the easiest ways to deal with certain types of errors in your code is by using exceptions. Exceptions allow you to check if something works, and if it doesn't, keep going. Error types can be specified or you can leave the type blank for the same treatment of all errors. The danger here is though that you might not catch errors that you should be catching and your output is not what it's supposed to be. It is recommended to always specify the error or errors that you want to except."
