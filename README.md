Python Notebooks for EADH

This is the pre-launch version of the "Coding for Digital Humanities" project funded by the European Association for Digital Humanites (EADH) small grant in 2021. It consists of 4 main notebooks that offer a steady progression in hands-on Python programming skills from complete beginner to advanced. You can choose your notebook based on your existing skill-/knowledge level.

The first notebook, called the introdcutory notebook, goes through the very basics of Python programming from commenting to data types such as integers, floats, and strings, to the concept of loops as well as how to open a file in Python.

The second notebook, the beginner notebook, delves deeper into lists (including list comprehension), dictionaries, and sets and focuses on skills relevant specifically for computational humanities and social sciences such as pre-processing steps for textual data including regular expressions and the Natural Language Toolkit (NLTK). Troubleshooting and probelm-solving is also discussed.

The third notebook, the intermediate notebook, looks at functions and classes as well as more advanced NLTK topics. Pandas, numpy, visualizations and data analysis in general is also introduced.

The fourth and final, advanced, notebook introduces lambda functions, machine learning and classification, as well as the basic ideas behind large language models such as BERT.

Together all of these notebooks offers a clear progressino from beginner to advanced and links to other relevant resources and tutorials that will help you focus on the topics you are interested in the most or feel that you need the most training in. Other resources include online books, tutorials, websites, and videos.
